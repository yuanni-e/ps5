We bring the BOOM .
That is what we do .
We bring the BOOM .
We bring the BOOM to you .
We bring the BOOM .
Across the red-white-and-blue .
We bring the BOOM .
You gotta meet our crew .
You know me as The Rizzler .
I am the panther dressed in black .
Once I give your girl the Rizz Face .
There is no chance she is coming back .
I hang with A.J. and Big-Justice .
Bring the Boom you know its on .
We are like the three evolutions of Pokémon .
I am Cousin-Angelo, I bring the Boom as you can tell .
With salami, provolone, and mozzarеlla .
Jersey-Joe is hеre, get on your feet and crank the volume .
Cause it is all about the family and it is all about the Boom .
